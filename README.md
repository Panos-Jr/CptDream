## The 'testing_services' Page -> **REPO**
### **HOSTED** : using Netlify - linked to **[GitHub](https://github.com/Panos-Jr/testing_services)**. 
##### LINK : You will be redirected to this page.
### You have been given the privilege to ameliorate '[index.html](https://github.com/Panos-Jr/testing_services/blob/main/index.html)'  
#### ***WEBSITE*** information -> Default Domain : '[testing-services.netlify.app](https://testing-services.netlify.app)' 
Custom Damain: **NOT purchased**
#### Any changes made on this repository (not replica's) will modify the website, directly 

## Extra Support - commands to use.
#### Firstly, you need to install 'Git'. Use this LINK : [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
#### Now, return to GitHub, click 'Fork' to replicate this repository (repo). By forking my repository, you will be able to edit the replica without making any changes to this repository. To make changes, you will need to create a pull request. (Read More to understand what a pull request is.)
#### Open 'Git Bash' on your machine. (Or a terminal)
##### Type **git clone {The Link of Your Copy Of My Repository}** Don't use the curly brackets. To get your LINK : Navigate to Code > Copy the Link under the HTTPS tab, Not SSH (there is a different process for SSH)
##### Then, you can type, **git remote add origin {type the link of the copy you have}** Don't use the curly brackets. This is not required (only recommended if an error appears).
### **Make your changes (on your master branch : or other branch)**
#### To create a branch and move to the created branch, type 
##### `git checkout -b branch_name`
#### `git branch branch_name` will create the branch called, **branch_name**.
#### `git checkout branch_name` will move into the branch called, **branch_name**.
#### `git push -u origin master` or `git push -u origin main` use `git branch --list` to check. (If you need to type 'master' or 'main')
#### Or any other branch name. 
#### This will push the contents of your master branch to origin (the repository on GitHub). In the command, '-u' is not required. Why origin? This is why we used `remote add origin https://...` it is like a shortcut to the repository (also known as **'repo'**). However, you won't have to type the command **git remote add https://**, since it is done automatically. Only use it when an error appears that mentions 'origin'.
#### Before `git push`, save your changes 

#### by typing `git add .` or `git add *`

##### and `git commit -m "The change you made."`


#### After using `git commit -m "change"`,
#### Disable 2-factor Authentication. (do this before using `git push`)
#### Then, navigate to your browser, refresh your (copy) repository on GitHub (or press Ctrl + R OR Command + R). You should see your changes pushed to your repository on GitHub. Now, navigate to 'pull requests' and click on' "New Pull Request," (or you should see a shortcut). After that, specify your changes and create your request. A pull request is a way of requesting me to pull your replica of my repository and merge it with the main repository. (In other words, add your changes to my repository)
